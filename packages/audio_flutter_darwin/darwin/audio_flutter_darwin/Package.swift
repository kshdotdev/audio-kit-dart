// Every source file under `Sources/audio_flutter_darwin` imports
// `Flutter`/`FlutterMacOS`, so that target only compiles inside a Flutter
// build — and `swift test` builds every target a package declares, not just
// the ones its tests depend on. Setting AUDIO_FLUTTER_DARWIN_CORE_TESTS=1
// narrows the package to the Flutter-free core plus its XCTest target, which
// is the only way to run `swift test` here; `tool/verify.sh` is what sets it.
//
// No Flutter build and no CocoaPods build ever sets it (there is no podspec),
// so what an application resolves is the `audio-flutter-darwin` library
// product exactly as before, with the core linked into it.
